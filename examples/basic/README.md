# Basic
Basic example of compiling and linking a single source file.

## Compiling
A minimal compile script is provided for compiling using MinGW GCC, Clang or MSVC.

These compile scripts are intended to be used as a reference for the command line flags
needed to run boflink correctly and not as a project build script template.

MinGW GCC (Linux)
```bash
./compile-mingw.sh
```

Clang (Linux)
```bash
./compile-clang.sh
```

MSVC (Windows)
```shell
.\compile-msvc.ps1
```
